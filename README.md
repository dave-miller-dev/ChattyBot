# ChattyBot

ABOUT:
A simple console chatbot. This was my first introduction to programming, ever. The beginning of my programming life. I'm hooked.

HOW TO RUN:
Run the .py file from your terminal application. Refer to OS for instructions.

OBJECTIVES:
My first introduction to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

ABOUT ME:
My name is Dave, I am 35 years old, currently learning to program with my first language, Python, whilst in COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne, Australia. My intention is to become a software developer in 2021 and beyond. I'm interested in back-end software development, as well as native audio software development (based on interest from my previous work). I plan to learn C++ as my next language.
